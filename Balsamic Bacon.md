# Balsamic Bacon

A  noodle topping.  Makes  one serving.  This is one of my  classic toppings for
[pulled noodles](Pulled%20Noodles.md).


## Ingredients & Instructions

- 2-3 strips bacon
- salt (optional)

Cut the bacon into small pieces.  Saute in a frying pan.  If your noodles aren't
ready yet, you can turn of the heat to wait;  the next step is pretty quick, and
you can do it while the noodles are boiling.

- balsamic vinegar
- garlic

Once the bacon is reasonaly cooked, add balsamic vinegar. Mince the garlic. Once
the balsamic vinegar has reduced, turn off the heat and add the garlic.

- fresh basil

Top noodles with the bacon sauce, then with chopped basil.


## Notes

For a southeast Asian twist, use soy sauce and peanut butter instead of balsamic
vinegar, and top with cilantro instead of (or in addition to) basil.
