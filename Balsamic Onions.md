# Balsamic Onions

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 2 lb pearl onions
- 2/3 C dried currants
- 1 T balsamic vinegar
- 1 C ruby port
- 2 tsp thyme
- butter

In a skillet, simmer all the ingredients above in butter. Wait for the liquid to
thicken; this might take half an hour.  Remove from heat.

- 1 T balsamic vinegar
- 1 tsp thyme
- salt

Add the additional vinegar and thyme.  Season with salt.


## Notes

You can often find frozen pearl onions in the supermarket - these are pre-peeled
and will save you a _huge_ amount of prep work.  If you can't find pearl onions,
shallots make a good "small onion" substitute.
