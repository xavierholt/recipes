# Bigos

This is a Polish "hunter's stew" with all sorts of meats,  some very interesting
spices, and sauerkraut.  Serve it with vodka and buttered rye bread.


## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1 1/2 lb chicken thighs
- 1 lb stew beef
- oil

Chop the meats into bite-sized pieces.  Brown them in oil in a dutch oven,  then
set them aside.

- 4 strips bacon
- 12 oz smoked Polish sausage
- red wine

Chop the bacon into small pieces. Fry it in the dutch oven. Cut the sausage into
discs or semicircles; add it to the frying bacon.  Deglaze with wine as needed.

- 2 onions
- 8 oz mushrooms
- 1/2 cabbage
- 10 prunes
- 1/2 tsp salt (optional)

Dice the onion and the mushrooms.  Slice the cabbage  thin.  Quarter the prunes.
Add all of these to the dutch oven. The water in the vegetables should come out,
making a broth; add a little salt to encourage this if necessary.

- 1 T tomato paste
- 2 tsp black peppercorns
- 2 tsp allspice berries
- 2 tsp juniper berries
- 6 bay leaves

Add all the seasonings.

- 1 jar sauerkraut
- vegetable broth

Add the sauerkraut and return the meat chunks to the dutch oven. Add just enough
broth to cover the other ingredients.  Cover and simmer for at least one hour.


## Notes

This is a  fusion recipe  based on a bunch of bigos recipes I found online;  the
quantities here  are what I used  the first time I made it.  Some of the recipes
also seasoned with caraway and marjoram, but I chose to leave those out and keep
the focus on the core (and more unusual) seasonings.

It doesn't really matter what meat you use, as long as it's dark meat.  Likewise
with the sausages: any smoked Polish-style sausage is good.

Don't  preemptively salt this!  The processed meats  and the sauerkraut are both
already salty, so this should need very little extra salt, if any.

I'm told this makes excellent leftovers.
