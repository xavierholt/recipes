# Buttermilk Pancakes

These are crispy around the edges and soft in the middle.  The main recipe makes
one serving  (about three pancakes).  For the  original four-serving recipe, see
the Notes section.


## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1/2 C flour
- 1 T sugar
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 to 1/2 tsp salt

Mix the dry ingredients in a medium bowl.

- 3/4 C buttermilk
- 1 T melted butter

Stir in the wet ingredients.  Some lumps are okay.

- oil or butter

Fry in  oil or butter  in a frying pan or on a griddle.  These are ready to flip
when they're set around the edges but the center is still wet.  Fry until golden
brown on both sides.  Serve with butter or jam or syrup or anything, really.


## Notes

This is a New York Times recipe that I cut down from  four servings to one while
I was home alone.  The original had two eggs. I tried it with one egg, but found
that too eggy.  If you like eggs better than I do, use 1/2 cup of buttermilk and
1 egg.

For reference, here are the original (four-serving) quantities.  The dry:

- 2 C flour
- 3 T sugar
- 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1 1/4 tsp salt

And the wet:

- 2 1/2 C buttermilk
- 3 T melted butter
- 2 eggs

Like all two-faced pan things, these can (and should!) be flipped airborne.  But
this can be a bit tricky, 'cause they're ready to flip before they're completely
solid.  Practice catching them gently to avoid splattering on impact.
