# Focaccia

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 2 C warm water (470g)
- 2 tsp yeast (7g)
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 T olive oil

Mix these in a large bowl.

- 4 C bread flour (560g)

Add flour, then mix with a spatula until it resembles a dough. No need to knead.
Cover and let stand for thirty minutes.

Dip your hands in water and stretch and fold the dough.  Repeat this four times,
rotating the bowl  90 degrees  between each repetition.  Then re-cover the dough
and let it stand for thirty minutes more.

- 3 T olive oil (and more)

Repeat this process five times. After the fifth stretch-and-fold (two and a half
hours after adding the bread flour), immediately transfer the dough to a 9-by-13
pan greased with 3 T of olive oil.  Drizzle the top of the dough with more olive
oil; coat it evenly.  Cover the pan and rest the dough for one more hour.

- olive oil

Gently reshape the dough to fit the pan, drizzle more olive oil. Then go "dimple
dimple dimple jiggle jiggle jiggle" until you smile with joy.

- toppings

Add whatever toppings you like. I've tried olives, rosemary, sun dried tomatoes,
and garlic.  Coat them in olive oil to prevent burning.

Bake, preferably in a convection oven, at 400 F for 20 to 22 minutes.


## Notes

The [original recipe][original] is from Emma Fontanella. It's worth watching her
[video instructions][video]  before making this the first time  so that you know
what the dough should look like.

Bread flour is ideal, but any high-gluten flour that has at least 12% protein by
weight should work.

For a  "cold ferment,"  stretch-and-fold four times,  then refrigerate the dough
overnight.  Stretch-and-fold one last time before transferring to the pan.
