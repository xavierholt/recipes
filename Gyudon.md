## Notes

The best beef I've used for this is a very thinly sliced beef, rolled into tubes
and frozen.  It's from an Asian grocery store,  and probably meant to be used in
hotpot.  If you can find  something similar, it'll give you a better result than
trying to slice the beef super thin yourself.

If you use fatty beef, consider skipping the butter; or perhaps cooking the beef
without butter, draining the fat off, and adding the butter later.
