# Kinpira

## Basic Instructions

- 1/2 to 3/4 lb vegetables
- 1 T toasted sesame oil

Slice the vegetables thin.  Soak them in water for ten minutes (add some vinegar
to prevent discoloration if desired).  Drain the water.  Stir-fry the vegetables
in sesame oil until almost tender.

- 1 T soy sauce
- 1 T mirin
- 1 T sugar
- 1 T sake
- 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper

Add the seasonings.  Cook until the liquid evaporates.

- toasted sesame seeds

Toss with sesame seeds before serving. This can be eaten at any temperature, and
stores well in the fridge.


### Kinpira Gobo

the sauce, reduce the sugar to 1/2 T. Drain the soaking water after five minutes
and replace it.


### Kinpira Renkon

For the vegetables, use 1/2 lb of lotus root. Increase the soy sauce to 1 1/2 T.
