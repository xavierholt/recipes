# Llama Sauce

A noodle toping. Makes two reasonably large servings.  This is one of my classic
toppings for [pn][pulled noodles].


## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1 medium to large eggplant
- 1/2 lb pork sausage
- oil

Chop the  eggplant into  small cubes.  Fry it in oil  with the sausage until the
mixture turns into  a chunky sauce.  The eggplant will absorb the oil  at first,
but then let it out again  as it cooks down,  so you don't need as much as you'd
think. You can add a little water and/or cover the pan to help cook more evenly.

- 2 cloves garlic
- 1-2 tsp crushed red pepper
- 3 T soy sauce

Mince the garlic.  Add the seasonings and continue cooking until the

- 4 cloves garlic
- prickly ash oil

Mince the rest of the garlic. Remove the sauce from the heat. Mix in the prickly
ash oil.  Either add the raw garlic to the sauce  or use it as a garnish.  Serve
over noodles or rice.


## Notes

A lot of the flavor in this comes from the sausage,  so using different sausages
will change the results significantly.  I typically use original Jimmy Dean, but
I've also used their sage and maple versions and liked both.

The name comes from me deliberately mispronouncing mala (麻辣), as in [malatang][mt].
