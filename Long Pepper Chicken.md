# Long Pepper Chicken

This is a slight modification of a simple [recipe][original] that emphasizes the
flavor of  [long pepper][pepper]  (which was dropped in favor of black pepper in
the thirteenth century).  The  [original inspiration][arthashastra]  is over two
thousand years old!


## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1 1/2 lb chicken thighs

Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces.

- 3/4 C plain yogurt
- 12 long peppers
- 1 T fresh ginger
- 1 tsp salt

Crush the long pepper in a mortar and pestle. Mince or grate the ginger. Mix the
peppers, ginger, and salt into the yogurt to make a marinade. Add the chicken to
the marinade, and marinate for at least thirty minutes -- possibly overnight.

- 1/4 C butter or ghee
- 1 tsp black mustard seeds

Heat the butter in a large pan.  Add the mustard seeds and let them sizzle for a
few seconds.  Add both the chicken and the marinade  and fry until golden brown.
Deglaze with a little water if necessary.

- lemon juice (optional)

Finish with a squeeze of lemon juice, if desired.  Serve over rice.


## Notes

The original recipe  splits the long peppers into two bunches of six:  the first
six go in the marinade, and the second six are added (whole!) to the butter just
after the mustard seeds.  They are edible,  and provide an intense burst of long
pepper  flavor.  But I think  most people would find them  distracting,  so I've
opted to add them all to the marinade instead.

The original recipe  also has you  fry the  chicken chunks  first,  then add the
marinade later.  In my hands,  though,  the marinade has always been super thick
and sticks tightly to the chicken, so it all ends up going in at once.

Three quarters cup of yogurt is one standard (6 oz) yogurt cup.
