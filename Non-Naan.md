# Non-Naan

I found this on All Recipes claiming to be naan. It's not. It's not even close -
it's more of a donutty fried bread.  But it is delicious. And we do tend to make
it whenever we make Indian food.


## Ingredients & Instructions

 - 1 packet yeast
 - 1 C warm water
 - 1/4 C sugar
 - 3 T milk
 - 1 egg

Mix the yeast, warm water, sugar, milk, and egg in a large bowl. Let stand until
the yeast has become active, about ten minutes.

 - 4 1/2 C flour
 - 2 tsp salt

Add the flour and salt.  Knead into a dough.  Let rise for about an hour.

Punch down.  Knead a little more.  Let rise another hour.

 - butter

Tear off golf ball-sized chunks of dough,  spread them into small circles (about
four inches in diameter),  and fry in butter on a  frying pan or  350Â° F griddle
until golden brown.
