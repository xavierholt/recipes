## Water-Based Pasta

- 50 g all-purpose flour
- 50 g semolina flour
- 50 g water
- 1/4 tsp salt

Knead all ingredients in a bowl;  they should form a ball of dough.  Let sit for
at least ten minutes.


## Egg-Based Pasta

- 100 g all-purpose flour
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 egg
- water

Put a bowl on a kitchen scale;  zero it.  Add the flour, salt, and egg, then add
enough water to bring the total mass to 150 grams.  Knead into a dough.  Let sit
for at least ten minutes.


## Cooking

- water

Bring some water to a boil.  Re-knead the dough,  flatten it, and run it through
a pasta machine.  Cook in boiling water for a few minutes, until it reaches your
desired firmness.


## Notes

It's possible to make noodles with a rolling pin and a knife,  but it's way more
effort than you'd expect.  A pasta machine will make your life a lot easier.

The dough  will be a lot  smoother the second time  you knead it; letting it sit
allows the gluten in the flour to polymerize and become elastic.  If you want to
let your dough sit for longer than half an hour or so,  cover it in a thin layer
of olive oil to prevent it from drying out.

Most Italian recipes  have you cook your pasta in a very large amount of heavily
salted water.  I don't bother with that; I just salt the pasta directly.
