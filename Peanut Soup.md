# Peanut Soup

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 2 tsp coriander
- 1 tsp grains of paradise

Dry-fry the spices until fragrant.  Cool.  Grind in a mortar and pestle.

- 1 onion
- 2 T butter
- 1 T sugar
- 1 tsp salt

Chop the onion fine.  In a large pot, fry it with the butter, sugar, and salt
until translucent and tender.

- 3 cloves garlic
- 2 tsp ground spices (above)
- 2 lb sweet potatoes
- 3 T peanut butter
- 3 C vegetable broth
- 2 C water

Chop the garlic.  Slice the sweet potatoes thin.  Add these, the ground spices,
peanut butter, broth, and water.  Simmer until everything gets mushy, about
half an hour.

- ground spices (above)
- shallots

Slice the shallots thin and fry them in a small pan until crispy.  When serving,
top each bowl with fried shallots and a sprinkling of the remaining spices.


## Notes

The original recipe wants you to puree this.  If you prefer a smoother soup,
puree it (and then re-warm it) right before serving.

If you don't have shallots, you can reserve a little bit of the onion.
