# Poppyseed Muffins

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 2 C flour
- 1/4 C poppyseeds
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp baking soda

Mix the dry ingredients in a small bowl.

- 1 C sugar
- 1/2 C butter, softened
- 2 eggs
- 3/4 C sour cream
- 1 tsp vanilla

Beat the sugar and butter  in a large bowl.  Blend in the  eggs, sour cream, and
vanilla.  Then add the dry ingredients.

Spoon batter into 12 greased muffin cups. Bake at 375 F for 15 to 20 minutes, or
until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.

Remove muffins from oven and cool on wire rack for 5 minutes. Remove from muffin
cups and finish cooling.  Serve warm or cool completely and store in an airtight
container at room temperature.  These muffins freeze well.  Makes 12 muffins.


## Notes

Yogurt seems to work  just as well as sour cream.  One standard cup of yogurt is
just about the amount called for; a six ounce cup is perfect.

Paper cupcake liners are recommended!
