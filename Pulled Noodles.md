# Pulled Noodles

Makes one large serving.

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1 C flour
- 1/3 C water
- 1/4 tsp salt

Mix all ingredients.  Knead.  Cover and set aside for 20 minutes.

- oil

Knead some more.  The dough should become very smooth.  Flatten the dough into a
1/2 inch high disc and rub with oil  (to preserve moisture).  Cover with plastic
wrap or a plate.  Let stand for 2 hours.

- water

Bring the water to a boil.  Slice the dough circle into 1/2 inch strips.  Gently
stretch these strips  until they become long,  thick noodles.  Place the noodles
directly into the boiling water.  Boil for about two minutes.


## Notes

To get thinner noodles, stretch them twice. The first pull should be able to get
the noodles to about pencil thickness without breaking them.  Lay these out flat
for five minutes or so and then stretch them again and you should be able to get
them to almost twice the length.

Use slightly less flour or slightly more water to get a stretchier dough.
