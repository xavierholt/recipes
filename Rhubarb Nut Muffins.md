# Rhubarb Nut Muffins

## Batter

- 1 1/2 cups flour
- 3/4 C brown sugar
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt

Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl.

- 1/3 C vegetable oil
- 1/2 C buttermilk
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp vanilla

Combine the wet ingredients in a separate bowl; add them to the dry ingredients.

- 1 C rhubarb
- 1/2 C walnuts

Toast and chop the walnuts.  Dice the rhubarb.  Fold both into the batter.  Pour
batter into a greased (or paper-lined) muffin tin.


## Topping

- 1/4 C walnuts
- 1/4 C brown sugar
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon

Toast and chop  the walnuts,  then mix them with the  other topping ingredients.
Sprinkle topping over the proto-muffins. Bake at 375 F for 20 to 25 minutes. Let
cool for ten minutes before removing and serving.


## Notes

There are toasted walnuts involved in two steps.  I recommend preparing them all
together. I like to toast nuts in the oven as it pre-heats; they'll be done when
the oven is ready.
