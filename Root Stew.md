# Root Stew

This is a nice simple stew. There isn't much in the way of seasoning, but that's
intentional: the highlights are the root vegetables.


## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1 1/2 lb stew beef
- olive oil

Cut the beef into one-inch cubes.  Brown it in olive oil in a large Dutch oven.

- 1 onion
- 4 cloves garlic

While the beef is cooking,  mince the onion and garlic.  Remove the beef (if you
feel like it)  and add  the onion  and garlic  to the pot.  Cook until  soft and
golden.

- 1/2 C red wine
- 3 C beef broth
- 2 T tomato paste
- 2 T butter
- salt

Deglaze  with red wine.  If you removed the beef,  put it back.  Add beef broth,
tomato paste, butter, and salt.  Cover.  Simmer for at least an hour and a half.

- 2 large parsnips
- 1 large celery root

Chop the parsnips and celery root  into one-inch chunks.  Add these to the stew.
Simmer, uncovered, for about forty-five more minutes.

- salt and pepper

Season with salt and pepper and serve.


## Notes

The original recipe has you cook the onion first, then add the beef to the fried
onions.  This tends to be a bit wet,  though,  so you can't get nice browning on
the meat.  I've reversed the order here to fix that.
