# Salmon Steaks with Herbs

## Ingredients & Instructions

Preheat oven to 400 F.

- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 yellow onion
- 6 T butter

Mince the garlic.  Chop the onions.  Simmer them in butter until tender.

- 1 tsp salt
- 2 T lemon juice
- 1 T fresh parsley
- 1/4 tsp tarragon
- 1/4 tsp thyme
- dash nutmeg
- dash mace

Add all the seasonings.

- 2 lbs salmon steaks
- 3/4 C bread crumbs

Lay the fish steaks in a baking dish  and top with half the onion mixture.  Stir
the breadcrumbs into the remaining mixture, and then spoon this over the fish as
well.  Bake for twenty to twenty-five minutes, until the fish flakes easily.


## Notes

I have only made this recipe with salmon,  but the recipe it's based on suggests
using cod, haddock, or halibut as well.

If you don't have mace, just add a little more nutmeg.
