# Smoked Salmon Sauce

I like to serve this over homemade linguini.


## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1 large shallot
- 1 fennel root (optional)
- 1/4 C butter

Slice the shallot and fennel thin.  Saute in butter  in a large frying pan until
soft and golden.

- 1/2 C white wine
- 2 tsp dried dill
- 1 C sour cream
- lemon juice

Add the white wine and dill and cook down, then add the sour cream and a squeeze
of lemon juice (up to an entire lemon's worth, if you like lemons). If the sauce
is too dry, thin it with milk or pasta water.

- 4 oz smoked salmon
- salt and pepper

Add flakes of smoked salmon; stir gently to avoid smooshing it. Season with salt
and pepper.  Serve over pasta.


## Notes

Use  "hot-smoked" salmon  for this.  It's the firmer style, which is cooked well
enough to flake (as opposed to lox or cold-smoked salmon, which is very soft).

If you use fennel root, save the greens for a nice garnish.
