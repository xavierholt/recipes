# Spaetzle

This is a German pasta equivalent.  It's easy to make, but you'll need a special
piece of equipment: a spaetzle board.  This is a board with holes drilled in it;
you press the batter through the holes into boiling water to get lumpy noodles.

Makes 4-6 servings.


## Ingredients & Instructions

- water

Fill a large pot halfway with water and bring to a boil.

- 2 C flour
- 1/8 tsp nutmeg (optional)
- 1 1/2 tsp salt

While the water is heating, mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl.

- 1/2 C milk or water
- 4 eggs

Stir in the wet ingredients.  When the water is boiling,  run the batter through
a spaetzle board and into the boiling water. Boil for two or three minutes, then
drain  in a colander.  If you want extra-chewy spaetzle,  rinse with cold water,
then reheat it on the stove with a little butter.


## Notes

We use this as a heavier alternative to rice or noodles: something to serve stew
or saucy foods on top of.  But where it really shines is as leftovers.  Take any
remaining spaetzle, fry it in butter with bacon or sausage, and top with a fried
egg for an amazing breakfast dish.

This can be noodlier or chunkier depending on your batter. If you mix the batter
for a long time, you should get a thicker batter and longer noodles.  We tend to
be lazy, and make a wetter batter that makes chunks rather than noodles.
