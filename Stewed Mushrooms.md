# Stewed Mushrooms

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1 large onion
- 1/2 C butter
- 1 T flour

Chop the onion fine and saute it in the butter in a very large pot.  Stir in the
flour.  Wait for the onions to get slightly soft.

- 3 lb mushrooms
- 1 bottle red wine
- 1 C vegetable broth
- 4 cloves garlic

If your mushrooms are large, chop them into bite-sized pieces. Mince the garlic.
Add the mushrooms, garlic, red wine,  and vegetable broth to the large pot.  Let
simmer for many hours.  The volume will reduce significantly.

- 2 tsp worchestershire sauce
- fresh parsley
- pepper
- salt

Before serving, stir in worchestershire sauce  and chopped parsley.  Season with
salt and pepper.


## Notes

I will often add salt to the onions as well, to ensure it mixes completely.

Realistically, the correct amount of wine is one bottle minus one glass.
