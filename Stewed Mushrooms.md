# Stewed Mushrooms

## Ingredients

- 1 large onion
- 1/2 C butter
- 1 T flour

- 3 lb mushrooms
- 1 bottle red wine
- 1 C vegetable broth
- 4 cloves garlic

- 2 tsp worchestershire sauce
- fresh parsley
- pepper
- salt


## Instructions

Chop the onion fine and simmer it in the butter in a very large pot. Stir in the
flour.  Wait for the onions to get slightly soft.

If your mushrooms are large, chop them into bite-sized pieces. Mince the garlic.
Add the mushrooms, garlic, red wine,  and vegetable broth to the large pot.  Let
simmer for many hours.  The volume will reduce significantly.

Before serving, stir in worchestershire sauce  and chopped parsley.  Season with
salt and pepper.


## Notes

I will often add salt to the onions as well, to ensure it mixes completely.
