# Tapsilog

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1 lb steak

Cut the steak into thin slices (about 1/8 inch).

- 1/4 C soy sauce
- 1 1/2 T brown sugar
- 3 cloves garlic
- juice of 1 lime
- 1/4 tsp pepper

Mix all ingredients to make a marinade.  Mix in the sliced steak.
Marinate overnight.

- garlic rice

Make garlic rice.  Sprinkling regular rice with garlic powder (or
garlic salt) works well, as does lightly frying minced garlic in
butter and pouring that over the top.

- 1 egg per serving

Fry the marinated steak over high heat until brown.  Serve over garlic
rice.  Top with a fried egg.  This goes wonderfully with atachara or
[pickled papaya][1].


## Notes

I used flank steak.  Slice it against the grain!  A pound of steak
will easily feed two people; multiply as necessary.

The marinade is very "dry," so I like to keep the marinading beef in
a ziplock bag to ensure good contact.
