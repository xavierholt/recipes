# Triple-Layer Carrot Cake

## The Cake

- 2 C flour
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 3/4 tsp ground nutmeg
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 2 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt

Mix the dry ingredients in a medium bowl.

- 2 C sugar
- 1 1/2 C vegetable oil
- 4 large eggs

Beat  the wet ingredients  in a large bowl until combined,  then beat in the dry
ingredients.

- 1 lb carrots
- 1/2 C toasted pecans
- 1/2 C golden raisins

Grate the carrots fine.  Chop the pecans.  Stir the carrots, pecans, and raisins
into the batter.

Line the bottoms of three 9-inch round cake pans with lightly greased wax paper.
Spread the batter evenly between pans.  Bake at 325 F until a toothpick inserted
at the center of a pan comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in pans for about
15 minutes, then turn out to cool completely.


Preheat oven to 325 F.  Lightly grease three 9-inch diameter cake pans with 1Â½-inch sides.  Line bottoms of pans with waxed paper; lightly grease waxed paper.  Using an electric mixer, beat sugar and vegetable oil in bowl until combined.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg into sugar and oil mixture.  

Stir in carrots, chopped pecans, and raisins.


## The Frosting

- 4 C powdered sugar
- 16 oz cream cheese, room temp
- 1/2 C butter, room temp
- 4 tsp vanilla

Let the cream cheese and butter come up to  room temperature,  then beat all the
ingredients in an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.


## Assembly

Place a cake tier on a large cake plate.  Spread with one third of the frosting.
Stack the next tier on top.  Repeat.  If you're feeling ambitious, save a little
frosting and use this to cover the sides.


## Notes

The cake can be made in advance. It can be stored for a day if simply wrapped in
plastic wrap, and will last much longer if frozen.
