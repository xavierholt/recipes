# Turmeric Fish

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1 T sour cream or plain yogurt
- 2 1/2 T fish sauce
- 1 T oil
- 1 T sugar
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp curry powder
- 1/2 tsp dill

Grind the garlic or chop it fine.  Mix all ingredients to make a marinade.

- 1 lb white fish

Chop the fish into medium chunks.  Marinate for half an hour to an hour.

- oil
- lemon juice (optional)
- dill (optional)

Fry the fish in the marinade until just done.  Add lemon juice and/or more dill
if desired.  Serve over pasta or rice.


## Notes

The fish can be quite fragile, so instead of frying both sides you can fry one
side, then cover the pan and let the steam cook the other side, a bit like
shallow poaching.  This way, you don't have to flip it.
