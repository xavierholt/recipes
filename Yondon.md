## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1/2 lb thinly-sliced lamb
- 1 onion
- 2 T butter

Fry the lamb and onions in butter in a large frying pan.

- 1 onion

Meanwhile,  slice another onion into one-centimeter slabs.  Grill or broil these
until very dark on both sides - black is okay.  Discard the charred outer rings.

- 2 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tsp fennel seeds
- 1 tsp red pepper flakes
- 1 tsp sugar
- 2 tsp salt

Season the lamb.  Mix in the grilled onions.  Serve over rice.


## Notes

This recipe is based on the form factor of gyudon, but with the flavors of cumin
lamb (yang). We like to use frozen curls of thinly-sliced meat, which are likely
intended for use in hot pot. Feel free to bump up the spice with a little ground
cumin and/or more red pepper!

I've used Vietnamese pepper leaves  (_Piper sarmentosum_)  as an almost-garnish,
slicing them thin and adding them a few minutes before serving.  I suspect fresh
shiso leaves would work very nicely as well; use these as a true garnish.
