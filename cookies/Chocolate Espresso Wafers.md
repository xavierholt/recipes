# Chocolate Espresso Wafers

Makes four or five dozen cookies.

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1 C flour (plus extra)
- 1/2 C cocoa powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp baking soda

Combine the dry ingredients in a medium bowl.

- 6 T butter, room temperature
- 1/2 C + 2 T white sugar
- 1/2 C brown sugar

Let the butter soften.  Beat the butter and sugar in an electric mixer.

- 1 egg white
- 1 1/2 T espresso powder
- 1 tsp vanilla

Mix in egg white, espresso powder, and vanilla. Mix in the dry ingredients. Form
the dough into a two-inch diameter log.  Wrap it in wax paper and refrigerate it
until cold: at least one hour and up to three days.

Slice  the log into  quarter-inch rounds.  Bake at  350 F  until the cookies are
cracked and almost firm to the touch in the center, about 14 minutes.


## Notes

The original recipe calls for 3 T butter and 3 T margarine. But we forgot to buy
margarine, and I like butter better anyway, so this is an adaptation.  There was
some concern  that the  all-butter version would melt or spread in the oven; the
extra flour (probably a couple tablespoons) was intended to offset this - and it
seems to have worked (they just came out of the oven).
